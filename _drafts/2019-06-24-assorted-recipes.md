I've been cooking a lot since moving to NYC, which has made me really happy. I haven't been documenting it as frequently on this blog though, so I'm afraid I might forget some of the really awesome recipes I've made. Eventually I might put together some sort of cookbook/gallery type thing to display all of the various recipes and photos, but for now I'll just dump them all here.
