I've been cooking a lot since moving to NYC, which has made me really happy. I haven't been documenting it as frequently on this blog though, so I'm afraid I might forget some of the really awesome recipes I've made. Eventually I might put together some sort of cookbook/gallery type thing to display all of the various recipes and photos, but for now I'll just dump them all here.

## Fish tacos

## Pickled red onions

Pickled red onions turn a gorgeous pink color in just a few hours, and are really easy to make. They make a good topping for a surprisingly large number of things - I've used them on fish tacos, burgers, and pizza.

### Ingredients:
- 1 large red onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 tsp salt
- 10 whole peppercorns

### Directions:
1. Peel and slice the red onion into thin strips.
2. Blanch the onions in a pot of boiling water for no longer than a minute, then stop the cooking with an ice bath.
3. Slightly smash the garlic and mix the remaining ingredients.
4. Stuff the onions into a mason jar, and pour the liquid mixture over it. Swirl, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, and keep up to a couple weeks.
