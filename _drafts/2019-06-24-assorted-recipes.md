I've been cooking a lot since moving to NYC, which has made me really happy. I haven't been documenting it as frequently on this blog though, so I'm afraid I might forget some of the really awesome recipes I've made. Eventually I might put together some sort of cookbook/gallery type thing to display all of the various recipes and photos, but for now I'll just dump them all here.

## Fish tacos

## Pickled red onions

Pickled red onions turn a gorgeous pink color in just a few hours, and are really easy to make. They make a good topping for a surprisingly large number of things - I've used them on fish tacos, burgers, and pizza.

### Ingredients:
- 1 large red onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 tsp salt
- 10 whole peppercorns

### Directions:
1. Peel and slice the red onion into thin strips.
2. Blanch the onions in a pot of boiling water for no longer than a minute, then stop the cooking with an ice bath.
3. Slightly smash the garlic and mix the remaining ingredients.
4. Stuff the onions into a mason jar, and pour the liquid mixture over it. Swirl, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, and keep up to a couple weeks.

This recipe I modified from [Sam the Cooking Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z2jTcsL28g) by adding garlic and increasing the peppercorns, some inspiration from Brad Leone from Bon Appetit, and my friend Fish.

## Blueberry pie

### Ingredients
Dough
- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbs sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 sticks unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup ice water

Filling
- 4 pints blueberries
- 5 tbs cornstarch
- 1 lemon's zest
- 1 lemon's juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup raw sugar, plus 1/4 cup for crust
- 1 large egg

### Directions
1. For the dough, whisk together dry ingredients, then place in a food processor with butter and ice water and pulse until a pebbly, sandy mixture forms.
2. Transfer dough to a work surface and knead until smooth. Periodically transfer to freezer if butter softens too much. Divide dough in half and form into two flat disks, then wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.
3. Toss blueberries, cornstarch, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and 3/4 cup raw sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for 30 minutes to soften.
5. Place an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet on the bottom rack (to catch spillage) and preheat the oven to 425.
4. Bring dough out of refrigerator and let rest for a couple of minutes to soften. Roll into two 16" rounds, about 1/8" thick. Transfer one into a deep 9" pie dish using the rolling-pin method, press into bottom, and trim sides.
6. Fill pie with blueberry mixture, and slice remaining dough round into 1" strips. Layer the pie with a 15 degree crosshatch pattern, leaving about 1/2" between strips.
7. Trim crosshatch to overhang by 1/2", and tuck overhang under the rim of the pie.
8. Brush visible dough with an egg wash and sprinkle with the 1/4 cup remaining raw sugar.
9. Bake pie 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375. Continue baking for an additional 60 minutes, then begin checking progress every 10 minutes. Once pie has been bubbling for at least 10 minutes and crust is golden brown, transfer to a wire rack and cool at least 4 hours before serving. Serve with freshly whipped cream.

This recipe I simplified slightly from [BA's Best Blueberry Pie](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-blueberry-pie), after obtaining an enormous quantity of really tasty blueberries. It turned out awesome on the first attempt, and I wouldn't change a thing.
