# Pottery

Recently I've had the opportunity to take some pottery classes at Mud Matters, which is luckily just a few blocks from my apartment. Pottery on the wheel falls into the general hobby category of "30% artistic, 70% technical skill", and so it's a natural fit for me, along with photography, woodworking, and cooking. I've mostly made bowls: vases require pulling the clay higher and using more material than you might expect (maybe about 4# of clay to make a 12" tall vase). Also, bowls are extremely useful for cooking - food automatically looks better if it's photographed in a handmade bowl.

The rate of skill increase is fairly dramatic - you can get a feel for how thin you can make the clay pretty quickly, and learn the right level of moisture the clay should be at (to little moisture and the friction creates too much torsional force, too much moisture and the clay loses strength quite quickly). In the first session I was able to make a couple of semi-ok bowls. In the second session I was able to make some decent small bowls. By the fourth session I was pretty happy with my bowls up to about 6" diameter x 3" height.

A few things that I found challenging at first:
- I made the bottom too thin, neglecting to account for how much I wanted to trim, plus the 1/8" or so that gets left after wiring off the pot.
- I forgot to tidy up the foot after throwing before wiring off - that's pretty recoverable, it can be trimmed off, but it makes the trimming more challenging, while spending about 30 seconds with a J-tool to tidy the foot before wiring off saves about 5 minutes of tricky trimming later.
- You can't really trim the inside of a bowl very easily - the shavings all wind up inside the bowl, which makes it very slow to trim because you have to keep clearing the shavings out. Therefore, the correct move is to smooth the inner surface while throwing, by using a metal kidney to very carefully shape the inside.
- It's difficult to trim the very rim of a bowl, because you need to use some lumps of clay around the rim to hold it on the wheel. However, using a spinner allows you to keep pressure down from the center while trimming the rim.
- The rim can be smoothed over with a wet sponge, and it's very tricky to get it perfect without this additional step.

I'm obviously no expert yet, and I'm looking forward to taking more classes in the future (I'm signed up for the advanced class for the next round of classes). In the meantime, here's some photos of the process:
