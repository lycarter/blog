Whew, it's been a while, hasn't it? I've been busy moving in to New York, starting a new job, and settling in, but I had some time to kill in a coffee shop, so let's catch up, shall we?

## Photography
- [CineStill Developer + Fix Monobath](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2018/06/film-news-cinestill-release-developer-fix-bw-monobath/): A monobath solution is pretty cool - I probably wouldn't be inclined to use it for developing film in TNQ's darkroom, because you don't get control over the exact development time, and it seems more temperature-sensitive, but this would be a great solution for a small apartment when you don't want to have lots of different bottles of chemicals. It'd be great for very small-batch film development.
- [Solarcan](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2018/06/camera-geekery-the-solarcan/): Basically a sheet of photographic paper in a can with a pinhole on the other side, it's so insensitive to light, and such a small aperture, that it pretty much just sits out for weeks or months at a time. These things produce some interesting pictures of the sun, revealing the changing path it takes through the sky. It would also probably be relatively easy to replicate with a webcam and some post-processing of the images.
- [Minolta 5400 film scanner](https://www.japancamerahunter.com/2018/07/guides-ultimate-scanning-guide-minolta-5400-meets-silverfast-8/): Apparently this particular scanner uses an internal lens made of unobtainum and has ridiculously good resolution. Possibly worth checking out and quantifying with an MTF. Regardless, this article also has some good tips on scan settings to get good results. The IR-based scratch/dust reduction is particularly interesting, I never knew that's how that worked. Seems like it would actually work incredibly well. Clearly I should get back into film photography and start scanning things.
- [Moon reconnaisance photo lab](https://hackaday.com/2018/08/02/the-photo-lab-that-flew-to-the-moon/): A super cool article on the tech that flew to the moon to do high-resolution reconnaisance for planning the Apollo missions. It basically had a full film setup, with chemicals and everything, and a scanner, because that was significantly higher resolution than digital sensors at the time (slash, digital sensors didn't really exist at the time, at least not in any usable form).
- [Sort-of tour of Nikon sensor testing lab](https://nikonrumors.com/2018/07/17/inside-nikons-secret-sensor-design-lab.aspx/): This links to some video tours of Nikon testing labs. There's also a bit of interesting discussion in the comments. It looks interesting, though I haven't actually had a chance to watch the videos yet.


## Networking
- [Deploying WiFi to a small office](https://triplebyte.com/blog/how-triplebyte-solved-its-office-wifi-problems): Just a little article I found on Hackernews about deploying a wifi network. My apartment is small enough not to need anything fancy, but down the line this could be useful. The biggest takeaway is just to not use WiFi, and hardwire as many things as possible instead. I definitely agree with that philosophy.

## Pi-hole
Pi-hole is a project to use a Raspberry Pi as a DNS server that blocks requests to ad sites, removing ads from your entire network (or, anyone that uses that as the DNS server), without any browser extensions.
- [Deploying pihole in a docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole/): There's an official docker container, which might be what I run if I ever actually decide to add this to my network setup. That depends on me getting the storage server back online, which is a project I've been meaning to do...

## Software
- [SVG packing for lasercutting/watejretting](https://deepnest.io/): A cool little bit of software with some cool algorithms behind it to pack shapes efficiently. Basically lots of Minkowski sums.
- [PyQT for GUIs in Python](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial): A comprehensive tutorial on using PyQT, a QT library for Python. There's also a good discussion [on Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18067684) about alternative Python libraries for building GUIs with more modern tools.

## Electronics
- [Octopart Excel plug-in](https://octopart.com/excel): An Excel plugin that automatically fetches prices and such from Octopart, which is super cool and useful. Definitely makes larger-scale electronics projects scale way better.
- [Breakdown of scaling LEDs O(50)](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/04/when-are-dumb-leds-the-smart-choice/): A cool breakdown of scaling an LED matrix to a few dozen LEDs. The board layout is also a beauty on its own. Really makes me want to go design some more circuit boards - the routing itself is a fun and relaxing task.
- [Mesh networking in the field](https://www.gotenna.com/pages/gotenna-pro-deployment-kit): A random kit I found that has a really nicely-designed package for ad-hoc mesh networking deployments. The small size and nice packaging are especially tasty.
- [Direction finding and passive radar with RTL-SDR](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/10/direction-finding-and-passive-radar-with-rtl-sdr/): Pretty much what the title says - direction finding of radio sources with SDR. Antoher cool project to try with SDR if/when I ever get into that hobby.




As always, thanks for reading! :)
