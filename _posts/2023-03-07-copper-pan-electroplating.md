## Introduction

Copper pans are the Rolexes of cookware (silver pans are the Richard Milles) - they're beautiful *and* immensely functional. There are a few features that you want in an ideal piece of cookware:
- High thermal conductivity to provide even heating
- High thermal mass to prevent temperature fluctuations

Copper has a thermal conductivity roughly 2-3x that of aluminum, and about 25x the thermal conductivity of stainless steel (that's why the best stainless steel pans are clad around an aluminum core, for better heat distribution). Copper also has a specific heat density about 1.5x that of aluminum and only a bit lower than stainless steel or cast iron, which means that it maintains heat about as well as an aluminum pan 1.5x as thick. Overall, [this article](https://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/120/Common-Materials-of-Cookware) does a good job of summarizing some of the pros and cons. Silver is the only superior material across the board, but is about 20x as expensive as copper, which itself is already almost 10x the cost of aluminum.

So, what is an engineer chef to do? I want the best (practical) performance, but new copper pans run about $300-600/pan. Additionally, thicker is clearly better for our thermal density part of the equation, and modern copper cookware doesn't tend to be as thick as some vintage pieces. [This article](https://www.vintagefrenchcopper.com/buyers-guide/frequently-asked-questions/) from Vintage French Copper, a lovely little blog about collecting copper cookware, does a good job of summarizing the impact of thickness on collectability and usability. To that end, the answer I came up with was to purchase some vintage copper cookware online. I got a few pieces - a set of beautiful, thick saucepans from 12cm to 20cm, a small oval fish pan, a large skillet, a medium-sized [Windsor](https://www.vintagefrenchcopper.com/2020/11/guest-post-a-tale-of-three-windsors/), and a medium-sized saute pan. The saucepans were all nickel-lined, while the rest were all tin-lined - of those, the Windsor and the saute pan were definitely in need of retinning, and I overheated the skillet on my very first time using it, melting the tin and ruining the surface (in retrospect, I wonder if this was properly tinned at all), which left me with 3 pans to attempt to repair.

## Linings

We haven't talked much about the linings for copper cookware - copper itself is reactive and would easily tarnish or leech copper into the food you cook if you were to cook directly on the copper (especially with acidic foods). Therefore, outside of a few very niche applications, copper cookware is lined - there are a few options for what material they're lined with, each with tradeoffs and benefits.

- Tin: This is the most "classic". It's supposed to be fairly nonstick, and is a very thin coating which doesn't impact the thermal conductivity very much. Unfortunately, tin has a melting point of about 450 Â°F, which is easily reached on the stove. If the tin lining becomes damaged, copper pots can be re-tinned professionally (doing this at home is a bit out of the question for an NYC apartment, due to the high temperatures and fumes).
- Stainless Steel: This is a very common option on modern cookware - it's easy to maintain, though almost impossible to repair if truly damaged. This can also impinge the thermal conductivity we value so much in copper cookware if the lining is too thick.
- Silver: This is arguably the best option, but is extremely rare, and generally carries all the same issues as pure-silver cookware: it's crazy expensive.
- Nickel: This is also fairly uncommon, presumably because it's a bit harder to apply (industrially) than tin, and because some people have nickel sensitivities that make it unsuitable for use. However, it can be applied thinly, and is harder and has a significantly higher melting temperature than tin. In my opinion, if none of the people you regularly cook for have a nickel sensitivity, this is the optimal lining. As a bonus, nickel can be electroplated at home fairly easily.

## Electroplating

That brings us to the bulk of this post - I had 3 pans in need of re-lining, and professional retinning services run about $80/pan, a bit steep when I've already paid about $100/pan on eBay. That's still an overall better deal than new copper, but with nickel as a lining option that can be applied via electroplating, I wanted to try restoring them myself.

I did a bunch of research on nickel electroplating - there's a [fantastic handbook](https://nickelinstitute.org/media/2323/nph_141015.pdf) about the process that goes through all of the important information - electroplating solutions, voltage and current calculations, etc. It basically boils down to a few key aspects: having an acidic electrolyte solution of nickel (different additives, different nickel salts, and different acids all have effects on the surface finish and efficiency of the process). These solutions can be purchased commercially, but in the interest of doing things as cheaply as possible, I elected to make my own solution from vinegar (acetic acid), which would produce a nickel acetate solution. From there, it's basically just apply voltage in the right direction and you wind up with nickel on your pot. There are, of course, some process variables that will impact the result. Here are the steps I took:

### Making the electroplating solution
As I mentioned, the electroplating solution can be puchased commercially, but I elected to make one by electrolysing nickel in acetic acid. I bought a 100g sheet of pure nickel online and cut it into a few strips to use as cathodes/anodes. To create the solution, I took one strip each as a cathode and an anode, and ran current through them. TODO<fill in details>.
