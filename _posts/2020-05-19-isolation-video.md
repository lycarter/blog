I bought a telescope a little while back, and decided to point it out my window the other day. It gives some very interesting views, since the focal length (2000mm) is so long. I decided that the isolated pockets that it could see were a sort of reflection of the isolated pockets that we're all living in due to quarantine, so I decided to take a few short video clips of interesting pockets I could see, and edit them together into a video.

Hope you enjoy, and thanks for watching.
