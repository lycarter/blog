I'm cleaning out some old bookmarks, so have a links-of-the-~~week~~-whenever-I-feel-like-it:

## Project-y
- [Microhydro](https://ludens.cl/paradise/turbine/turbine.html): Someone built an off-grid hydro power setup, and this goes into a lot of detail. Seems likely to be more reliable and cheaper per watt than solar.
- [Linear CCD Scanning Camera](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/30/linear-ccds-make-for-better-cameras/): I've always wanted to build a large format digital camera, and a scanning linear CCD seems to be the best way to do it. This guy (...3 years ago...) did that, and the results were...fine.
- [High Speed Flash](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/16/an-impeccably-designed-high-speed-led-flash/): To capture very fast things, the easiest way to do it is to go into a dark-ish room, set up a long-ish exposure, and use an incredibly bright, incredibly short-duration flash to light up the microsecond that you care about. Normal commercial flash units aren't usually fast enough (many microseconds to single-digit milliseconds, if memory serves), so this is a DIY LED-based microsecond flash. If I ever have something incredibly fast to capture, this is definitely what I'd copy.
- [Raspberry Pi E-Ink Calendar](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/11/get-organized-with-this-raspberry-pi-e-ink-calendar/): I intend to do a project similar to this at some point in time.
- [LaTeX web renderer](https://github.com/susam/texme): If I wasn't already using Kramdown + mathjax for rendering LaTeX on this site, I'd probably use this. I saved this note on Oct 26, 2018, and as of Oct 5, 2022, the last update was 12 days ago, so that's pretty impressively active.
- [Web App -> Electron](https://hackaday.com/2018/12/05/linux-fu-turn-a-web-app-into-a-full-program/): Turn a web app into an electron app very easily.

## Entertainment
- [Parody Wikihistory edits](https://www.tor.com/2011/08/31/wikihistory/): I don't remember where this came from or any context around it whatsoever, but it's entertaining so here ya go.
- [Red Dragon Glass Sculpture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhNj9qbbv5s): If you enjoy this, also go check out the Netflix series Blown Away.
- [Graphic Art of The Incredibles](http://joshholtsclaw.com/blog/2018/3/5/the-graphic-art-of-incredibles-2): The Incredibles is one of the prettiest Disney/Pixar movies recently, and has an amazing soundtrack too.
- [In Tune With Time - Watchmaker Masahiro Kikuno](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/8x0lsb/in_tune_with_time_watchmaker_masahiro_kikuno_2015/): Unfortunately this seems to have been taken off of Youtube, but with some simple Googling it should be possible to find a copy. This is a really cool documentary about a really cool watchmaker making a really cool watch.

## Reference
- [Writing Resilient React Components](https://overreacted.io/writing-resilient-components/): For the once a year that I actually write React (really, once every 2-3 years nowadays...)
- [Speed Booster Optical Design](https://www.metabones.com/assets/a/stories/Speed%20Booster%20White%20Paper.pdf): Really cool paper on why and how a speed booster (basically the opposite of a teleconverter) works.
- [Watchmaking Book](https://theindex.nawcc.org/Articles/Grossman.pdf): If I ever want to get into watchmaking forrealz, this is where I'd start.
- [x86 vectorization](https://gamozolabs.github.io/fuzzing/2018/10/14/vectorized_emulation.html): Very detailed article about x86 vectorization that apparently I found really interesting back in 2018.
- [CSS Flexbox cheat sheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): Another one to add to the list of resources for the extremely rare occurrence of me doing any frontend web development.

## Puzzles
- [Mystery Hunt 2019 puzzles](https://www.reddit.com/r/mysteryhunt/comments/ajtk3q/writing_about_the_puzzles_i_wrote_for_the_2019/): Boy you can really tell how old these bookmarks are, huh...

As always, thanks for reading! :)
