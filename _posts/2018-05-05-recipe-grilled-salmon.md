(Makes about 4 servings)

# Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 lbs salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces
- lemon pepper to taste
- garlic powder to taste
- salt to taste
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/3 cup water
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil

# Directions:

1. Rub salmon with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt to taste.
2. Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Whisk to combine. Put into a plastic bag with the salmon to marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.
3. Pan fry the salmon on medium-high heat in a healthy skillet of vegetable oil for about 6-8 minutes per side. The skin side of the salmon will char, but that's fine. For bonus presentation points, grill the top of the salmon fillet in a ribbed cast iron pan. This will also prevent excessive char flavor.

I used to make a salmon recipe from my mom, which was just salmon, slathered with italian dressing and broiled for about a half hour, which was very tasty. However, I needed the oven for other things and wanted to branch out a bit, so I found [this recipe online](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12720/grilled-salmon-i/) from allrecipes. In principle, the flavors are very similar to the italian dressing recipe I made, but the method of prep encourages a more intense char and crisps the salmon more. The brown sugar helps add some nice caramelization and color.
