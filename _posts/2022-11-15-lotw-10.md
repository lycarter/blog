Just a single link for this week, also from [Tom Scott's newsletter](https://pad26.aweb.page/subscribe):

- [brr.fyi](https://brr.fyi/): This IT guy is deploying in Antartica, and is posting a bunch of really interesting behind-the-scenes things. Considering the logistics of how to actually get things to Antartica is really wild. I particularly enjoyed [Laundry at the End of the World](https://brr.fyi/posts/laundry-at-the-end-of-the-world), [Condition Two](https://brr.fyi/posts/condition-two), and [The McMurdo Wastewater Treatment Plant](https://brr.fyi/posts/wastewater-plant).

As always, thanks for reading! :)
