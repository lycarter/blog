From Jun's Kitchen

4 servings; 4-6 crepes

## Ingredients:
For the glaze:
- 50g sugar
- 50g butter
- 1 1/2 cups orange juice
- 40 mL Grand Marnier

For the crepes:
- 20g melted butter
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 100g flour
- 2 eggs
- 240g milk
- 5 tbsp butter, for the pan

Toppings:
- 1/2 orange, supremed
- 150g whipping cream
- 30g sugar

## Directions:
1. In a wide skillet, prepare the glaze by combining sugar, butter, and orange juice, and simmer on medium until it reaches the consistency of good maple syrup.
2. Turn the burner off, then add Grand Marnier and ignite with a torch to flambe. Make sure to invite guests over for the show!
3. Mix together crepe ingredients in a large bowl, then strain to remove lumps and transfer batter to another bowl.
4. Over medium-low, melt 1 tbsp of butter until foaming, then portion ~1/4 cup of batter into the pan, flipping when bubbles start to appear on top and the bottom is lightly browned.
5. Briefly soak finished crepe in glaze before folding in quarters and leaving in the pan with the glaze (heat still on).
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all batter has been used. As the pan becomes too full, transfer crepes to a plate to serve, lining them up on top of each other with the point of the quarter-circle pointing in the same direction.
7. Drizzle any remaining glaze on top, along with supremed orange slices.
8. Whip cream and sugar to soft peaks, and top each serving with a healthy dollop.
