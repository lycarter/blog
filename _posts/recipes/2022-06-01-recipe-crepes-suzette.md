From Jun's Kitchen

4 servings; 4-6 crepes

## Ingredients:
For the glaze:
- 50g sugar
- 50g butter
- 1 1/2 cups orange juice
- 40 mL Grand Marnier

For the crepes:
- 20g melted butter
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 100g flour
- 2 eggs
- 240g milk
- 5 tbsp butter, for the pan

Toppings:
- 1/2 orange, supremed
- 150g whipping cream
- 30g sugar

## Directions:
1. In a wide skillet, prepare the glaze by combining sugar, butter, and orange juice, and simmer on medium until it reaches the consistency of good maple syrup.
2. Turn the burner off, then add Grand Marnier and ignite with a torch to flambe. Make sure to invite guests over for the show!
3. Mix together crepe ingredients in a large bowl, then strain to remove lumps and transfer batter to another bowl.
4. Over medium-low, melt 1 tbsp of butter until foaming, then portion ~1/4 cup of batter into the pan, flipping when bubbles start to appear on top and the bottom is lightly browned.
5. Briefly soak finished crepe in glaze before folding in quarters and leaving in the pan with the glaze (heat still on).
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all batter has been used. As the pan becomes too full, transfer crepes to a plate to serve, lining them up on top of each other with the point of the quarter-circle pointing in the same direction.
7. Drizzle any remaining glaze on top, along with supremed orange slices.
8. Whip cream and sugar to soft peaks, and top each serving with a healthy dollop.

# Crêpes Suzette
(makes about 2 servings)

### Ingredients:

Crêpes:
- 10g melted butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 50g flour
- 1 egg (beaten)
- 120g milk

Glaze:
- 20g sugar
- 20g butter
- 10 mL Grand Marnier
- 10 mL Cointreau
- 1 cup orange juice
- a scoop of vanilla ice cream

### Directions:

1. Combine the crêpe ingredients. I combine them in that order, but it's resulted in lumpy batter, so there might be a particular order that works best. Warming the milk before adding it might also help to keep the butter melted. That completes the crêpe batter, but we'll prep the glaze before making the crêpes.
2. In an 8" skillet, melt butter and sugar.
3. In a small cup or wine glass, combine Grand Marnier and Cointreau. Heat slightly and light with a long-necked lighter. Ensure the flame is steady, remove the skillet from the stove, turn off the lights, and pour into the skillet to flambé. Make sure to do this in front of guests - it's a showy technique, which is the whole point.
4. After the fire has extinguished and the alcohol has boiled off, return the skillet to the stove and add the orange juice. Lower the heat to leave the mixture on a low simmer.
5. Returning to the crêpes, heat another skillet over medium with a small amount of vegetable oil. Cook crêpes one at a time, making sure to get them nice and round. After each crêpe is complete, fold it in half and transfer to the simmering glaze.
6. After simmering briefly in the glaze, fold the crêpe again to form quarters and plate with a bit of extra glaze and a quenelle of vanilla ice cream.

I found this recipe from [Jun's Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF9zOykErJ4), though he shows a slightly fancier version of the recipe. I had a lot of trouble getting the flambé to work the first couple of times I tried the recipe - I accidentally added the orange juice first one time, and tried to flambé on the plate the second time, which also failed. I also managed to get it to mostly work once, but the flame isn't very bright, so it's not very pretty when the lights are on. For the dinner party though, it went perfectly. The quenelle of ice cream really finishes the presentation.
