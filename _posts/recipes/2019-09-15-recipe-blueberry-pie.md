# Ingredients
Dough
- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbs sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 sticks unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup ice water

Filling
- 4 pints blueberries
- 5 tbs cornstarch
- 1 lemon's zest
- 1 lemon's juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3/4 cup raw sugar, plus 1/4 cup for crust
- 1 large egg

# Directions
1. For the dough, whisk together dry ingredients, then place in a food processor with butter and ice water and pulse until a pebbly, sandy mixture forms.
2. Transfer dough to a work surface and knead until smooth. Periodically transfer to freezer if butter softens too much. Divide dough in half and form into two flat disks, then wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.
3. Toss blueberries, cornstarch, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and 3/4 cup raw sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for 30 minutes to soften.
5. Place an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet on the bottom rack (to catch spillage) and preheat the oven to 425.
4. Bring dough out of refrigerator and let rest for a couple of minutes to soften. Roll into two 16" rounds, about 1/8" thick. Transfer one into a deep 9" pie dish using the rolling-pin method, press into bottom, and trim sides.
6. Fill pie with blueberry mixture, and slice remaining dough round into 1" strips. Layer the pie with a 15 degree crosshatch pattern, leaving about 1/2" between strips.
7. Trim crosshatch to overhang by 1/2", and tuck overhang under the rim of the pie.
8. Brush visible dough with an egg wash and sprinkle with the 1/4 cup remaining raw sugar.
9. Bake pie 5 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375. Continue baking for an additional 60 minutes, then begin checking progress every 10 minutes. Once pie has been bubbling for at least 10 minutes and crust is golden brown, transfer to a wire rack and cool at least 4 hours before serving. Serve with freshly whipped cream.

This recipe I simplified slightly from [BA's Best Blueberry Pie](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-blueberry-pie), after obtaining an enormous quantity of really tasty blueberries. It turned out awesome on the first attempt, and I wouldn't change a thing.
