(makes about 1 loaf, or 14 dinner rolls)

# Ingredients:
- 2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 500g baking flour
- 2 eggs
- 150 mL milk
- 100g butter
- 50g sugar
- 8g salt
- 1 egg, whisked, for the egg wash

# Directions:

1. Proof the active dry yeast in the warm water by dissolving it and letting it bubble.
2. Mix the ingredients in, in order, using a stand mixer with a dough hook. Continue kneading at low speed until a sticky dough forms, about 3 minutes total.
3. Cover the mixing bowl and proof for a bit over 2 hours in a warm place. I use the oven with the light on, which works pretty well and is out of the way.
4. Remove the dough, which should have doubled in size, and preheat the oven to 400 Â°F.
5. For a loaf, flour the countertop and separate the dough into 3 equal logs, about 40 cm long and 5 cm in diameter, braid together, and put in a loaf pan. For dinner rolls, work dough into golf ball sized balls, pinching the dough to ensure one side is smooth. Put that side on top, and fill a muffin tin.
6. Cover, proof for an additional 20 minutes, and brush with the egg wash. Bake loaf for about 25 minutes and rolls for about 12 minutes.

This recipe I got from [Alex French Guy on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY19NK7qBCU), and was inspired to try it after watching my roommate bake sourdough bread on a weekly basis. It was surprisingly difficult to form the dinner roll shape, since the dough was very sticky. I find that the loaf produces about 10 solid slices of bread, and I tend to enjoy them best when toasted lightly. The dinner rolls are best fresh - I overcooked them a bit when keeping them warm, which made them a bit drier and a bit harder, instead of soft and fluffy as they were fresh out of the oven. They don't really need additional butter.
