Carbonara is a very simple pasta dish that's just a bit more refined than spaghetti (unless you make your own spaghetti sauce, at which point it becomes significantly more involved). I've made it a few times, and while it's hard to get perfect (I tend to either scramble the eggs a bit or add too much pasta water), it's always super tasty regardless.

# Ingredients:
- 1 lbs bucatini or thick spaghetti noodle
- 1 lbs thick bacon
- 7 egg yolks
- 1/2 cup grated Pecorino/Parmesan
- 2 tsp black pepper

# Directions:
1. Cook the bacon and pasta, timing to finish cooking at around the same time.
2. Cut bacon into bite-sized pieces and whisk with egg yolks in a large bowl.
3. Add pasta to bowl along with 1/2 cup pasta water, and toss vigorously with tongs.
4. In batches, stir in cheese and pepper.

This recipe is essentially [BA's Best Carbonara](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-silkiest-carbonara), but substitutes bucatini and bacon for rigatoni and guanciale.
