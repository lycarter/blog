This was a recipe my mom used to make every now and then, and is very similar to [this recipe on allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/oven-roasted-asparagus/). It's a super easy way to prepare asparagus. The only annoying thing is that the oven is then too hot to keep the rest of the dishes warm right before dinner. I can see why people like having 2 ovens now - one to cook in, the other to just keep things warm.
