12-16 servings

### Ingredients:
- 3 racks of pork ribs (10 lbs)

#### Dry Rub
- 3 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp ground mustard
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp white pepper

#### Sauce
- 2 cups apple cider vinegar
- 1 1/2 cups ketchup
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 cup yellow mustard
- 2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp salt

### Directions:
1. The day before, trim the silverskin off the pork and apply the dry rub liberally.
2. For the sauce, whisk together the ingredients and simmer until syrupy (the consistency of cream, not honey - it will tighten up as it cools), about 1- 1 1/2 hrs.
3. Preheat oven to 235-250 째F.
4. Line a sheet tray with a bed of aluminum foil. In addition to that, wrap and crimp the ribs with additional aluminum foil.
5. Bake for 2-2 1/2 hrs. (todo: what temp did the meat register at this point?)
6. Remove the top of the aluminum foil wrapping around the ribs and bake for an additional 1 1/2 hrs, basting with the sauce every 20 mins.
7. During the last 10 mins, crank the temperature to 500 째F to form a crust. (todo: what temp did the meat register at this point?)

I don't remember exactly what led me to originally try this recipe on 7/9/20 - I think I was looking through Babish's basics book and decided this looked tasty. It came out great on the first try, then a little dry on the second try - I tweaked the instructions at that point to 235 째F instead of 250 째F. The next time I try this, I'll try to record all of the internal temps a lot more closely to maybe make a temperature graph. I'll also probably consult r/smoking (bbq, not cigarettes), which has lots of great advice on low-and-slow cooking.
