Large sea scallops can be pretty expensive, but they're very easy to cook and turn out restaurant-quality or better. I typically make them with a mushroom and pea risotto.

# Ingredients:
- 1/3 lbs fresh sea scallops (the large ones) per person
- salt, pepper, oil

# Directions:
1. Pat scallops dry, then season lightly but thoroughly with salt and pepper. Ensure all scallops are arrayed "right side up" (see video).
2. Heat pan over medium until oil is shimmering. Sear scallops, about 3-4 minutes per side. Judge entirely based on color, and modulate temperature to ensure middle of scallop isn't raw.

This one is all about achieving that beautiful seared scallop top, for which the video from [Carla at Bon Appetit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USMWKNh3cB4) is invaluable.
