These made the rounds on [Chris Morocco's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/moroccochris) and were a big hit as "yonuts". They live up to the hype.

# Ingredients
- 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 6-8 cups vegetable oil, for frying (can be reused 1-3 times)
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 lemon's zest

# Directions
1. Whisk dry ingredients together.
2. Whisk wet ingredients together, and fold in dry ingredients until a dough barely comes together (but no spots of flour remain).
3. Turn out dough onto well-floured workspace, dusting top with more flour. Roll to 1/2" thick.
4. Punch out circles 3 1/2" diameter (I used an inverted ramekin), poke a hole through the center, and widen hole to about 1" diameter. Brush off any excess flour and set aside. Reroll scraps into donut holes, about 1 1/4" diameter.
5. Pour oil to a depth of 1 1/2", and heat until oil registers 350 Â°F.
6. Fry donuts, turning once, until puffy and browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack to cool before glazing.
7. Whisk powdered sugar, lemon zest, and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl until smooth. Coat donuts in glaze.

As mentioned, this recipe came from [Chris Morocco at Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/lemony-glazed-cake-doughnuts), and it was nearly perfection, though I increased the lemon zest by a decent amount my second time making them (reflected in the recipe above). This makes enough for 3 hungry people, or 4 normal people.
