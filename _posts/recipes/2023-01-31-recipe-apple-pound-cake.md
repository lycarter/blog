12 servings

### Ingredients:
- 1 stick butter
- 2 tsp vanilla paste
- 3 tbsp heavy cream
- 3 large eggs
- 3/4 cup (150g) sugar
- 1 1/4 cup (150g) sifted cake flour
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 apple, peeled and thinly sliced

### Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 Â°F and line a 9"x5" loaf pan or 8" round cake pan with parchment paper.
2. Melt butter in a pan, then add vanilla and whisk in cream.
3. Whip eggs and sugar for 4-5 mins at medium speed.
4. Sift together dry ingredients, then fold into the egg and sugar mixture.
5. Slowly stir this mixture into the cooled butter mix.
6. Pour into the selected pan, then shingle apple slices on top, and bake for 50-60 mins.

Joanne Chang (founder of Flour, one of my favorite Boston-area restaurants!) ran an Instagram series in the first Fall of the pandemic to promote baking at home (and sold bake kits for it...). She originally did this one in a rectangular loaf pan, but I decided that a full round pan with nicely-shingled apple slices wound be fun to make and look really good, plus I had some apples in October when I made this originall (10/6/20).
