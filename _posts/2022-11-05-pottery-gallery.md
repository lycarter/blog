For some background, check out my [previous post]({% post_url 2022-10-06-pottery %}), which discusses a bit more about my experiences getting into pottery. This post will be a chronological gallery of the pieces I've produced so far, along with a little bit of commentary on certain pieces. On the off chance that you really like a particular piece, I'd love if you would reach out and let me know. If you actually like one enough to want to buy it, or if you'd like to commission a piece, please get in touch as well, those are both things I'm open to.

<figure name="1" alt="1" caption="My very first piece, a simple mug. It's quite heavy and chunky compared to anything I've made since."></figure>

<figure name="17" alt="17" caption="In researching chawans, I discovered @thrown_and_altered on instagram, who used slip and other techniques to add interesting texture to his work. In trying to mimic that style, I made this small 8-sided cup."></figure>
<figure name="18" alt="18" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="19" alt="19" caption="I didn't know it at the time, but this form which I've now revisited 3 times in increasing size is known as a 'moon jar'. Not done in time for this post, I have a very large (~10 inch diameter) moon jar in the works"></figure>
<figure name="20" alt="20" caption="I really hoped the glaze at the top would run a lot more than it wound up doing"></figure>
<figure name="21" alt="21" caption="This is the only traditional vase shape I've made that I'm actually happy with. Unfortunately, like the previous piece, the glaze didn't quite do what I wanted here, and I wound up with dots instead of long streaks"></figure>
<figure name="22" alt="22" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="23" alt="23" caption="At the time I threw this, it was the largest and thinnest bowl I'd thrown, so when I chipped it right before putting it in to fire, I decided to just run with it. It now has an integral spoon rest."></figure>
<figure name="24" alt="24" caption="The pair of rice bowls here, as well as the pair of teacups that I made at the same time, are probably my favorite pieces."></figure>
<figure name="25" alt="25" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="26" alt="26" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="27" alt="27" caption="This is now my personal teacup, which is great, because Amy likes its mate better."></figure>
<figure name="28" alt="28" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="29" alt="29" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="30" alt="30" caption="A bit hard to tell from the photo here, but this is shaped into a rounded-off triangle and has a hole in the bottom to be used as a small flowerpot. I have a particular small cactus that I intend to put here when I get around to it."></figure>
<figure name="31" alt="31" caption="This piece has some chattering on it, inspired by Hsinchuen Lin"></figure>
<figure name="32" alt="32" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="33" alt="33" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="34" alt="34" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="35" alt="35" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="36" alt="36" caption="This planter is one of the overall most technically perfect pieces I've thrown. The form and glazing are all perfectly even. It will soon be delivered to a friend of mine as a belated wedding present."></figure>
<figure name="37" alt="37" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="38" alt="38" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="39" alt="39" caption="This trio of pieces came to life during a studio session where I couldn't find any success throwing on the wheel. I absolutely love the way the glaze turned out here."></figure>
<figure name="40" alt="40" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="41" alt="41" caption=""></figure>
<figure name="42" alt="42" caption="This pie plate is, as of November 2022, the piece I've spent the longest working on. It was originally intended to also be a belated wedding present, but the glaze pooled at the bottom a bit, and I'm deciding whether I want to remake it or not."></figure>

That's all I've got so far. I've roughly arranged these in chronological order, so you can see the growth in my skill throwing and glazing over time. Like I said at the top, if any of them catch your eye, drop me a note. Thanks for reading! :)
